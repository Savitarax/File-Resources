A Word On This Topic and Explanation:

These are the original files AMITXV created and I linked initially on my channel. 

However it has come to my attention that AMITXV has gone completely private/deleted his entire collection of tools and services. 


This includes Twitter/Github/Discord etc.
AMITXV was immensly helpful to me and so many others and I hope that you all realize this.


As far as I'm aware of the situation it seems that he was driven out by the very community he built and helped, whether this was toxicity or harassment is still undetermined at this time. 
I don't have contact information with AMITXV. I wish I did but sadly that is not available.

Going forward PLEASE donate to AMITXV and support him even if he isn't with us anymore contributing or communicating. This was his donation page that thankfully is still up.

When you use these tools know that someone dedicated their time and effort to making them a reality for us.

If you still want to view his repo tuning guide that is unbelievably comprehensive and detailed here is the link.

I am not affiliated with this person in any way/shape/form and I have no reason to assume that he has any relationship with AMITXV either. Please do not contact him requesting anything unless explicitly stated. 
If you value anything I have ever done then please again considering donating to him. I can't thank him enough for the short time I had learning from him. 
I'll keep this post updated as time progresses with a "UPDATED DETAILS" Section at the bottom of the post should anything come up.

Have a good one guys
